# circlecitesting


This repo exists entirely for experimentation with CircleCI builds.  The current config does nothing but sleep some times and echo some things, but it is useful for testing CirlceCI behavior. 

The first use was to help building in the API-polling `watch` command in [buildevents](https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents).
